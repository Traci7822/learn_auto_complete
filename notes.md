To toggle on the content menu, click the paper icon on the left side of the text input field
Saved content will appear in the drop down menu, selecting content from the list will output that text to the input field

-Need to mark that content is saved
-entering '@' covers up toggle image
-capital letters not accounted for in autocomplete yet

-Set the width for input field to avoid overlap
