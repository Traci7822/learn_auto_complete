To use:

Clone repo

In chrome extension settings check the developer mode checkbox
Click 'Load unpacked extension...' and select repo folder
Enable the 'Getting started example' extension and reload the Learn Expert chat window

In Learn Chat:
After typing content you want saved into the text input, click the green down arrow button to save content
Saved content will appear in the drop down menu, selecting content from the list will output that text to the input field
If you type in a word in the input field it should filter the dropdown menu to contents containing your input (need to bring this back in)
Use red x to remove content from storage data





To-Do:

- look at escaping parenthesis to counter invalid RegExp
- remove blank option from filtered menu
- integrate autocomplete - filter
- tab trigger to autocomplete
- Switch to MutationObserver for checkForResolved() and refreshes
- change to page action instead of browser action
- reload menu after saveButton
- entering '@' covers up toggle image (maybe fixed)
- capital letters not accounted for in autocomplete yet
